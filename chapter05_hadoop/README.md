## <del>Cascading</del> *Cascalog* for the Impatient

This serie is based on the excellent tutorial named "Cascalog for the Impatient", a series of tutorial 
and [Cascalog](http://www.cascalog.org/) code examples to get you started. This series is a fork of [Cascading for the
Impatient](http://www.cascading.org/category/impatient/).

This set of progressive coding examples starts with a simple file copy and builds up to a MapReduce implementation of the TF-IDF algorithm.
