## Running
    git clone https://github.com/overtone/mini-beast.git
    cd mini-beast
    lein run

## Tips
* Make sure your MIDI devices are connected before starting the beast
* Click on a knob slider, selector, or wheel and adjust the control on your MIDI device.
* The beast remembers your control bindings, so once you've bound one control, bind another!
* You can save and load bindings and presets using the `File` menu.

## A call for patches
MiniBeast loads a default patch, but we need your help! There is a world of sounds and timbres waiting to be explored.
When you happen upon an unusual or interesting patch, please save it and share it. Pull requests work or post them to
the Overtone [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/overtone). 

Enjoy making new sounds!
